== Part 1.1 - Components

The components involved in the publishing process are the content which
is marked up using the simple but powerful http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc]
and the https://toolchain.gitbook.com/[Gitbook] toolchain of publishing libraries.
To further simplify the collection and installation of the toolchain components I've
encapsulated them all into a Docker image which is then fronted with a script to
run the various commands to keep the tools that have to be locally installed
to a minimum.

=== Locally Installed

The following tools should be installed on your local system. The publishing toolchain has
been installed within a Docker container and orchestrated with a Makefile.
