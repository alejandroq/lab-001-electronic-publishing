= Part 2.1 - Markup Content

The website content uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] to annotate content and
the labs use the slightly more complex http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] to be able
to do some more advanced text formatting. Regardless of the language used the ability to focus on content rather than
the formatting greatly accelerates the writing process.

Once the generation and markup of content has been completed we save the finished source files to a local
https://git-scm.com[Git^] respository and when ready to publish push the local changes to a shared repository.
