= Part 2.1 - Markup Content

The website content uses the lightweight markup language https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] and
the labs use the slightly more complex http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] to be able
to do some more advanced text formatting.

Regardless of the language used the ability to focus on the content rather than the formatting
greatly accelerates the writing process. Once the content has been annotated it can be tranformed into
many different final products.
