= Part 2.1 - Markup Content

The website content uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] to annotate content and
the labs use the slightly more complex http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] to be able
to do some more advanced text formatting. Regardless of the language used the ability to focus on content rather than
the formatting greatly accelerates the writing process.

Once the markup of content has been completed the finished source files are saved to a local
https://git-scm.com[Git^] respository and when ready to publish pushed to a shared repository which triggers the build
of the content into the various formats and the publishing to the CDN.
