= Part 2.1 - Markup Content

The website uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] to annotate content and
the labs use the slightly more complex http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc] to be able
to do some more advanced text formatting. Regardless of the language used the ability to focus on content rather than
the formatting greatly accelerates the writing process.
